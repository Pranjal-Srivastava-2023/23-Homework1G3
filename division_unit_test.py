# This code has the same functionality as your original code but in a more simpler way.

def division(x, y):
    return x / y if y != 0 else "ERROR"
result = division(6, 2)
print(result)
    
#output=3.0

    # Here x / y is calculated when y is not equal to 0 (i.e., when division is possible).
   # y != 0 : If y is not equal to 0, it returns the result of x / y, which is the division result. (using conditional statement)
   #  If y is equal to 0, it returns "ERROR" to indicate a division by zero error.
